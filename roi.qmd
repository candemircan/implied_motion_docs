# ROI Extraction

We extracted the following ROIs from the Wang et al. 2015 Atlas:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Early Visual Areas
    - V1
    - V2
    - V3

- Motion Areas
    - V3a
    - hMT
    - MST

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Object Areas
    - V3b
    - hV4
    - LO1
    - LO2
    - VO1
    - VO2


- Parietal Areas
    - IPS (posterior)
    - IPS (anterior)
    - SPL1

First, the following was code to extract all the relevant ROIs for each participant.


```{r}
#| class-output: "sourcecode bash"

cat(readLines("src_implied_motion/src/sh/get_roi.sh"),sep = "\n")
```

Then, the following code was used to **a**) remove overlapping voxels from all ROIs **b**) merge some of the 'raw' ROIs given by the atlas.

```{r}
#| class-output: "sourcecode bash"

cat(readLines("src_implied_motion/src/Py/merge_rois.py"),sep = "\n")
```
