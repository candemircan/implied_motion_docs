# Cross Decoding

Here, I tried to decode the direction of motion, using a classifier that was trained and tested on different types of data.
Meaning we trained a classifier in a two fold cross-validated fashion, where we tested on real motion and test on implied motion, and then trained on implied motion and tested on real motion.
The classification problem was again split into two (left vs. right and forward vs. backward), and the rest of the pipeline was the same as the previous decoding pipeline.
The whole classification procedure was as follows.

## Code Used

```{r}
#| class-output: "sourcecode python"

cat(readLines("src_implied_motion/src/Py/mvpa_cross.py"),sep = "\n")
