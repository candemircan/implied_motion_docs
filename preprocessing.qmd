# Preprocessing MRI Data

The following two scripts were used to preprocess the imaging data.
The first script calls the second one for each participant and submits seperate jobs for parallelisation on the server.

```{r}
#| class-output: "sourcecode bash"

cat(readLines("src_implied_motion/src/sh/fMRIPrep_parallel.sh"),sep = "\n")
```

```{r}
#| class-output: "sourcecode bash"

cat(readLines("src_implied_motion/src/sh/fMRIPrep.pbs"),sep = "\n")
```
